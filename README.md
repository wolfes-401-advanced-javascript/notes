### Setup

#### `.env` requirements (where applicable)

- `PORT` - 3000
- `MONGODB_ATLAS_URI` - URL to the running mongo instance/db

#### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

- `node index.js` must include flags listed below
- use flags `-a` or `--add` combined with a note in "" to add a note
- use flags `-l` or `--list` to list the notes in the db
- use flags `-d` or `--delete` combined with the id of a note to delete that note
- use flags `-u` or `--update` combined with the id and what you want the note to say, to update the note (not working yet)

#### How to use your library (where applicable)

#### Tests

- How do you run tests? `npm test`
- Any tests of note? I really like the test where I create a new note and then delete it.
